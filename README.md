The Student Grade Calculator is a software project that aims to create a system for calculating and displaying the final grades of students based on their marks in different subjects. The project consists of the following components:

- An input module that takes the marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject from the user. The user can enter the marks for any number of subjects.
- A calculation module that performs the following operations on the input marks:
  - Calculate the total marks by summing up the marks obtained in all subjects.
  - Calculate the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the total number of subjects.
  - Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved using a predefined grade criteria. For example, A for 90% and above, B for 80% to 89%, and so on.
- A display module that shows the results to the user. The results include the total marks, the average percentage, and the corresponding grade.

The project uses Java as the programming language and follows the object-oriented design principles. The project also includes documentation and testing of the system.
